Image Classification and Confidence Scoring                                                                                                          

•	Developed a machine learning model for classifying images of athletes & actors, where the model was trained to estimate the likelihood of correct classification based on a dataset of images. The model was designed to output a confidence score indicating the certainty of its predictions.

•	Dataset Size and Confidence Correlation: During the project, it was observed that the confidence score of the model's predictions was influenced by the size of the dataset:
- Smaller Dataset (~25 images): The model achieved an average confidence score of around 40%. This lower confidence can be attributed to the limited amount of data, which restricts the model's ability to generalize effectively.

- Larger Dataset (~50 images): The confidence score increased to around 70%. With more images available, the model had more data to learn from, improving its ability to make accurate predictions and increasing the confidence score.

•	The project highlights the importance of dataset size in machine learning, where larger datasets generally lead to better-trained models with higher confidence in their predictions. This demonstrates the model's dependency on data availability for accurate performance.
